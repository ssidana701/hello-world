Hello Humans!

Git-Publisher here, I am new to Git Hub so I am writing something here following the tutorial on Git Hub's website. 
The orange looking avatar on the tutorial looks like a Charmander, wonder if the author likes fire-type pokemon. 
We shall have a friendly challenge and let's see how water pokemon stands up against the wrath of fire pokemon.
